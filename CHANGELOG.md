  [#435](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/435)
- The EVMC loader trims all extensions (previously only the last one)
  from the EVMC module file name.
  [#439](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/439)

  by dropping prefix words from the name.
  [#440](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/440)
- The helper function `evmc_is_abi_compatible()` returns now `bool`
  instead of `int`.
