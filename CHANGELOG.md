  [#455](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/455)
  [#490](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/490)
  [#503](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/503)
  [#512](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/512)
- New **evmc command-line tool** has been added. At the moment it supports
  command _run_ for executing bytecode in any EVMC-compatible VM implementation.
  Try `evmc run --help` for more information.
- C++: EVMC basic types `address` and `bytes32` have all the comparison operators supported.
  [#474](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/474)
- C++: Convenient constructors from `uint64_t` added for basic types `address` and `bytes32`.
  [#488](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/488)
- C++: Added `VM::get_raw_pointer()` method to directly access VM C API when needed.
  [#492](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/492)

### Changed

- CMake minimum version required has been bumped to [3.10](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.10/release/3.10.html).
  [#495](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/495)

### Fixed

- The implementation of C++ `operator<` for `evmc::address` and `evmc::bytes32` has been fixed.
  [#498](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/498)


## [7.1.0] — 2019-11-29

### Added

- Added `MockedHost` C++ class (in form of header-only `evmc::mocked_host` library)
  which can be used to emulate Host behavior when testing VM implementations.
  [#456](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/456)
- In the Rust bindings added more type aliases (`MessageKind`, `MessageFlags`, `StatusCode`,
  `StorageStatus`, `Revision`).
  [#206](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/206)
- In CMake the `evmc::evmc_cpp` target has been added which represents the C++ EVMC API.
  [#470](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/470)

### Changed

- Require Rust 1.37.0 as a minimum.
- In the Rust bindings mark read-only functions in `ExecutionContext` as non-mutating.
  [#444](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/444)
- In the C++ `HostInterface` the logically read-only methods are marked with `const`.
  [#461](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/461)
- Updated dependencies of the Rust bindings to latest stable versions.
  [#462](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/462)

## [7.0.0] „Istanbul Ready” — 2019-11-11

This version of EVMC delivers compatibility with Istanbul EVM revision.
The ABI breaking change has been required in this case so some other 
backward-incompatible changes are also included and deprecated APIs have been 
removed.

### Added

- Support for **Istanbul** EIP-1344 (CHAINID opcode). 
  `chain_id` added to `evmc_tx_context` struct.
  [#375](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/375)
- Support for **Istanbul** EIP-1884 (Repricing for trie-size-dependent opcodes).
  [#372](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/372)
- The **Berlin** EVM revision number has been added.
  [#407](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/407)
- In C++ API, an overload for `VM::execute()` has been added that omits
  the Host context and interface parameters. This is useful for Precompiles VMs
  that do not interact with the Host.
  [#302](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/302)
- In C++ API, the `VM::has_capability()` method has been added.
  [#465](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/465)
  
### Changed

- The `evmc_instance` renamed to `evmc_vm`.
  [#430](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/430)
- The `evmc_context` renamed to `evmc_host_context`.
  [#426](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/426)
- The `evmc_host_interface` is now separated from `evmc_host_context`. 
  This simplifies language bindings which implement the `evmc_host_interface`.
  [#427](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/427)
- The `evmc::vm` renamed to `evmc::VM` in C++ API.
  [#252](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/252)
- Previously deprecated `helpers.hpp` header file has been removed.
  [#410](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/410)
- Previously deprecated `EVMC_CONSTANTINOPLE2` and `EVMC_LATEST_REVISION` revisions have been removed.
  [#411](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/411)
- Previously deprecated tracing API has been removed.
  [#429](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/429)
- In `evmc::instructions` library the undefined instructions have `0` gas cost
  instead of previous `-1` value.
  [#425](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/425)
- The EVM instruction tables have been redesigned to be more useful.
  [#435](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/435)
- The EVMC loader trims all extensions (previously only the last one)
  from the EVMC module file name.
  [#439](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/439)
- The EVMC loader no longer ties to guess the VM create function name 
  by dropping prefix words from the name.
  [#440](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/440)
- The helper function `evmc_is_abi_compatible()` returns now `bool`
  instead of `int`.
  [#442](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/442)
- In the Rust bindings make `ExecutionContext` optional within `execute`.
  [#350](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/350)
- A set of small improvements to C++ API.
  [#445](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/445)
  [#449](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/449)
  [#451](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/451)

  but replaced with new `evmc::is_zero()` in API compatible way.
  [#406](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/pull/406)

### Fixed

- In C++ API the `get_balance()` method now returns expected `evmc::uint256be` 
  instead of `evmc_uint256be`.
